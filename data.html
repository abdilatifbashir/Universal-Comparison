        <p>It is the distance that light can travel in one year. Light moves at a velocity of about 300,000 kilometers (km) each second. So in one year, it can travel about 10 trillion km. More p recisely, one light-year is equal to 9,500,000,000,000 kilometers.</p>

        <p>Polaris known commonly as the North Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation of Ursa Minor. It is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. The distance to Polaris is about 433 light-years

        <p>VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a red hypergiant star located in the constellation Canis Major. It is one of the largest stars and also one of the most luminous of its type. It has a radius of approximately 1,420 solar radii (990,000,000 km; 6.6
          au), and is 17 ± 8 times as massive as the Sun. Located about 1.2 kiloparsecs (3,900 light-years) from Earth, it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye.</p>

        <p>Rigel is generally the seventh-brightest star in the night sky and the brightest star in the constellation of Orion.It is some 863 light-years distant from Earth. The star as seen from Earth is actually a multiple star system of three to five
          stars, the primary star being (Rigel A) a blue-white supergiant which is estimated to be anywhere from 120,000 to 279,000 times as luminous as the Sun. It has exhausted its core of hydrogen and swollen out to between 79 and 115 times the Sun's
          radius. It pulsates quasi-periodically . Quasiperiodic behavior is a pattern of recurrence with a component of unpredictability that does not lend itself to precise measurement.</p>

          Aldebaran hosts a planet several times the size of Jupiter. The planetary exploration probe Pioneer 10 is currently heading in the general direction of the star and should make its closest approach in about two million years.</p>

        <p>Sirius(Dog Star) is a star system and the brightest star in the Earth's night sky. It is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness
          over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.Sirius is about twice as massive as

        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" target="_blank">The Sun</a></h2>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.t is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, i.e. 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth,
          accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and
          its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, one of which is the predominant calendar in use today. </p>

        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter" target="_blank">Jupiter</a></h2>
        <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. </p>
        <p>The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter is bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.</p>
        <p>The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed
          since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo
          Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury. Jupiter has been explored on several occasions by robotic spacecraft, most notably during the early Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions and
          later by the Galileo orbiter. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which
          entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016.Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn" target="_blank">Saturn</a></h2>
        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but with its larger
          volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive.Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle.</p>
        <p>The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 62 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named. This does not
          include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial
          atmosphere.

        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus" target="_blank">Uranus</a></h2>
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that
          of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition
          of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planet(−224 °CF), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the
          lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived directly from a figure from Greek mythology, from the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky Ouranos. Like the other giant planets,
          Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and
          south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.
          Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).</p>

        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.It has no natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon.As the
          closest planet to Earth, Venus has been a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962), and the first to be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970).
          Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but
          they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions. </p>
